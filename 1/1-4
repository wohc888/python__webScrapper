function


1. function is defined in pythong, no declarence
ex)
def say_hello()

2. no {} in python when defining functions

def say_hello():

3. use indentation to notice the body of a function
ex)
def say_hello():
    print("hello")
    print("bye")

4. difference between say_hello, say_hello()
say_hello === does nothing
say_hello() === launch function
